            Comparison of two computer architectures: PDP-4 and ICT 1300

                                  Introduction

The Digital Equipment Corporation Programmed Data Processor-4 (PDP-4) 
is designed to be the control element in an information processing system.
Flexible, high-capacity input-output capabilities of the PDP-4 enable it to 
operate in conjunction with a variety of peripheral devices, such as per- 
forated-tape readers and punches, punched-card readers and punches, 
Teletype printer-keyboard, line printers, magnetic tape transports, and 
analog-to-digital converters.The machine is completely self-contained, requiring no special power sources, air conditioning, or floor bracing.
