            Comparison of two computer architectures: PDP-4 and ICT 1300

                                  Introduction

The DEC Programmed Data Processor -4 is a compact solid-state stored program digital computer. The PDP-4 is designed explicitly to bring to special purpose systems the flexibility, economy, and reliability of a production model general purpose machine. he basic function of the PDP-4 is to collect information from, and distribute information to a wide variety of peripheral devices accordin,g to a predetermined set of instructions.

2. Elementary base of PDP-4 computer's processor was descrete trasistors and for memory were using magnetic core. It means that transistors were sold and you could replace them separetly.
