            Comparison of two computer architectures: PDP-4 and ICT 1300

                                  Introduction

The DEC Programmed Data Processor -4 is a compact solid-state stored program digital computer. The PDP-4 is designed explicitly to bring to special purpose systems the flexibility, economy, and reliability of a production model general purpose machine. he basic function of the PDP-4 is to collect information from, and distribute information to a wide variety of peripheral devices accordin,g to a predetermined set of instructions.

2. Elementary base of PDP-4 computer's processor was descrete transistors and for memory were using magnetic core. It means that transistors were sold and you could replace them separetly. The PDP‑4 was pretty big computer, its weight was around 450 kilograms. Its measured roughly 68cm × 171cm × 162cm.
