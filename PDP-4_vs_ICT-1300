            Comparison of two computer architectures: PDP-4 and ICT 1300

                                  Introduction

The DEC Programmed Data Processor -4 is a compact solid-state stored program digital computer. The PDP-4 is designed explicitly to bring to special purpose systems the flexibility, economy, and reliability of a production model general purpose machine. he basic function of the PDP-4 is to collect information from, and distribute information to a wide variety of peripheral devices accordin,g to a predetermined set of instructions.

2. Elementary base of PDP-4 computer's processor was descrete transistors and for memory were using magnetic core. It means that transistors were sold and you could replace them separetly. The PDP‑4 was pretty big computer, its weight was around 450 kilograms. Its measured roughly 68cm × 171cm × 162cm.From a single source of 115-volt, 60-cycle, single-phase power, PDP-4 produces circuit operating dc voltages of -15 volts (± 1) and +10 volts (± 1) which are varied for marginal checking. Total power consumption is 900 watts. 


3. PDP-4 computer is an accumulator-based.The accumulator, AC, is the major register in the arithmetic unite. It serves both as an accumulator and as an in-out register. The accumulator input logic includes transfer,rotate, logical, and arithmetic gating. The accumulator is used in the execution of all two-term logical and arithmetic instructions. Furthermore, the result of all such instructions always appears in the accumulator. The AC input gating allows the computer to perform the logic functions AND, exclusive OR, and negation, as well as arithmetic operation of addition. All other arithmetic operations must be programmed by using combinations of negation and addition. The inclusive OR function must be programmed by combining negation and conjunction. All transfers of information between the computer and low-speed or programmed peripheral devices are made through AC. 

4. A single X winding and a single Y winding intersect at a single memory location containing an 18-bit core register. During each memory cycle information is read from or written into the single addressed core register. This addressed register is selected from among the 4096 (1024) registers in the core bank by selecting the single X winding and the single Y winding that intersect at the corresponding memory location. 

5. PDP-4 computer's logic is divided into four parts: control unit, arithmetic unit, memory and input-output system. But only control unit and arithmetic unit have registers.The control unit includes three internal registers: IR(instruction register-4bit), PC(program counter-13bit) and MA(memory register-13bit), and two console switch registers, AS(address switches) and ACS(accumulator switches) and those registers are specialised.The arithmetic unit includes two 18-bit registers, AC(accumulator register) and MB(memory buffer register), and a 1-bit L register.

6. PDP-4 have 2 flags: Link register wich often is used as overflow flag in 1's and 2's compliment and I/O flag.

7. PDP-4 system have 18bit machine word.

8. PDP-4 computer system have continuous type of memory layout.Its efective address is 12 bits.Extended version of PDP-4 with 15 bits addresses could work with up to 32K 18bit words, but usually it had 4k 18bit of words in capacity.

9. PDP-4 system do not have virtual memory, because CPU is working directly with memory, with real addresses.

10. PDP-4 is 18 bit, accumulator-based, single-address instruction set.This system have 16 instructions. There are two classes of PDP-4 instructions: memory reference instructions like: AND, JUMP, ADD, TAD(2's compliment), LAC, DAC, DZM, etc. and augmented instructions like:
